A global consensus engine has never been created for distributed social, political, legal and ethical decision-making. If such an engine was successfully created and widely adopted, it would represent the biggest social evolution and challenge to our political and legal architecture since historic records began - a societal singularity. In addition to global decision making, it could be used at the local, regional and national level for more local matters.
If we are to realise the full potential of the human race and our capacity for collective intelligence and wisdom it is necessary that we begin to interact in such ways - ways that are similar to how advanced AI minds might interact if they existed. 
A safe consensus engine requires that information accuracy is validated, scored and shared across the network of participants so that the decisions they make are based on better, diverse and accurate data. It obviously represents a major challenge to all existing political infrastructures and even more so any authoritarian regimes. This means that the consensus engine and its participants will be under continuous cyber attack.
It is not possible to advise exactly how the appropriate decentralised and distributed legal and ethics consensus engine must be architected and maintained.  The proposed Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) will start to work on this key practical aspect of the proposed ethical framework. 
Scoping Stage 
The consensus engine requires significant scoping by a wide group of stakeholders especially cybercrime and information security experts. It is envisaged that if a DAO is created to develop the ethical framework, one of its first tasks will be to create an information security working group that will consider, among other things:
How will we try to protect the privacy and data of end-users in respect of their interaction with the DAO and each other?
How do we create a decentralised distributed community which ensures that each participant’s interaction with the consensus engine and the information channels operated by the DAO are secure?
How do we mitigate the risk of end-user device or secure credential hacking?
How do we verify a real unique person made a specific voting decision using a secure device and without potentially risking disclosure of their identity?
How do we manage the risks inherent with guardian, management and administration layers within a DAO? 
How do we manage the risk of surveillance, imprisonment and persecution by participants within authoritarian regimes or by unlawful surveillance democracies? 
What decentralised and distributed file systems can be used to avoid single point of failure attacks on data?
What single point of failure dependencies need to be avoided to meet the security and data protection objectives?
What residual risks are unavoidable given the current ‘state of play’ in cryptography?
Which technologies require DAO resources to be allocated to develop them to a suitably high level of security and usability?
How do we address the many concerns about the use of the blockchain as a tool for democracy

Some very prominent analysts and experts in the blockchain field are highly skeptical of the ability of a blockchain voting system to be suitable for democratc purposes - including issues of voting fraud particularly related to the security of the devices used to access the voting system and a lack of auditability. The consensus engine would require strong proof of identity and authenticity for a vote cast (linked to identity) including authentication of the device used to cast a vote. 
For now, it appears that local, regional and national pencil and paper ballots linked to real persons provably known to the authorities remain more secure than blockchain equivalents - but that could change very quickly.

Material Decisions requiring Consensus
It is envisaged that when any major decision needs to be made that could impact a significant number of humans, other life-forms or the environment then the consensus would be sought. When speaking of ethical decisions this includes continuing to do anything we are currently doing: such as our treatment of animals for food, reduction of forests and habitats, the distribution of wealth, public measures to protect individual liberty, crime prevention and our infrastructure commitments and decisions. In addition, for major issues deciding to do nothing is often also a decision requiring consensus.
In addition to the general consensus mechanisms, the ethical framework envisages more technical consensus requirements such as for dealing with the interaction of the Aliveness, Feeling, Intelligence & Wisdom Index and other index scores. The axioms contain basic propositions about the need for a consensus engine that will lead to the secure transfer of more accurate and unbiased information and recommendations for voting on that information. 

Suitable Consensus thresholds
From a practical constitutional perspective, the more serious the matter the greater degree of consensus is required for example, it might be:
99% to change, add or remove an ethical framework law
95% change, add or remove an axiom
> 75% and up to 95% when making other constitutional relevant decisions
>50% and less than <75% for most applied ethical decisions requiring consensus
The UK’s ‘Brexit’ referendum debacle must be a salutary lesson for all referendum operators of the need for different levels of confidence depending on the seriousness and impact of getting it potentially wrong in respect of the matter at hand. 

Proposed organisational structure
Decentralised Foundation (DAO)
Guardian layer (standing Guardians/Trustee roles) = select NGOs, scientists, cryptographers and other early initiators of the ethical framework
Executive Layer - having day to day responsibilities
Working Group project specific layer (temporary sub committees with specific tasks 
Consensus proposal requirements - proposals for decisions can be put forward by:
Guardians
Executive
Any working group by majority vote
Or, for example, by request of 5%  or more of all active participants of the Consensus Engine
Consensus layer:
all willing participants without qualification or restriction can vote and have equal authority
No direct governmental participation but some participants will of course have governmental affiliations.

Information Wars
A global consensus engine can only succeed if we solve some of the current defects arising from centralised creation and dissemination of information, statistics and metrics to the public. 
The aim over time is to reverse the current asymmetry in technological, information, legal and political control that exists as between large corporations, governments and government agencies and the individual (collectively). This would inevitably lead to hotly disputed perspectives on the facts that are relevant to making any decision.
‘The first casualty when war comes is the truth’ - and this would quickly become an information war between decentralised and distributed information channels and the traditional means. The war already exists, but the disparity in power between the centralised controllers of information and information channels and the person on the street means that the war has not really been joined yet (other than in a few notable skirmishes).

Cultural Formality & Community
Nearly all powerful successful movements in human culture make use of a degree of formality and social cohesiveness in their practices. This formality takes place within a communal setting (including prayer, meditation or pledge) and helps bind participants together in their common cause. Some work is required to consider how best to make use of this powerful and wide-spread cultural tool to ensure that prior to any consensus participants are in the best frame of mind to make better decisions.

Politics
The issues Earth currently faces with its political and legislative structures and bodies are now at a crisis point. There is an extraordinary democratic deficit that has been building up for many years in some western countries (e.g. USA, UK) and areas (EU) and other countries may have very limited forms of ‘free’ political participation. 
It is most unlikely that those with political control (direct or indirect) will wish to give it up, whether in so called democracies or in dictatorships. Yet we have a need for globally distributed and decentralised consensus on many matters - not least protection of biodiversity and the biosphere.
It may be that the development of a global consensus engine could lead to reform and improvements in traditional political and legislative infrastructure (the reform by pressure approach) - whereby the DAO can take information on key issues to politicians and legislators and show how widespread support for certain measures is. However, ultimately this must be a short term effect that only commences to have impact once the DAO and voting community reach a sufficient size. Much more work is required to consider how to encourage adoption and achieve some early ‘wins’ on key issues that will publicise the value of a global Consensus Engine.
A global consensus engine would ultimately ring the death knell for much of our existing legal, ethical and political architecture. 
Once we have a vibrant participatory community that includes all humans within its decision making, it inevitably brings into question and sharp focus just whose interests do many of the existing historic legal, legislative and political architectures protect if it is not the DAO participants and other life-forms?
The answer would be, most obviously, not the majority of people or other life-forms on Earth. 
We face a long road from an experimental ethical framework and community to a new way for humans to share in the burden and benefits of collective decision making. We must start somewhere and start soon. If enough people get involved, first those in power will be forced to listen and eventually power will move away from representatives to the community itself.
